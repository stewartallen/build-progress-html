## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- A web server (nginx, Apache, Python, etc.)
- The `progress.json` data file generated by [`build-progress-cli`](../build-progress-cli)

### Installation

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Place `progress.json` in the same directory as `index.html`
3. Serve the files using any static web server:

```bash
# Python 3
python3 -m http.server 8000

# Node.js (after npm install)
npm run serve

# Or use nginx, Apache, etc.
```

4. Open your browser to `http://localhost:8000`

## Data Format

The dashboard reads `progress.json` with the following structure:

```json
{
  "log": [
    { "date": "2022-02-02", "hours": 4.4 },
    { "date": "2022-02-03", "hours": 0.0 }
  ],
  "statistics": {
    "total_hours": 1528.4,
    "days_worked": 473,
    "avg_hours_per_week": 7.9,
    "avg_hours_last_6_weeks": 3.4,
    "est_completion_date": "2028-02-21",
    "est_completion_date_6_weeks": "2031-04-07",
    "hours_current_week": 0.0,
    "hours_current_month": 7.0,
    "hours_last_30_days": 14.8,
    "current_streak": 0,
    "record_streak": {
      "days": 9,
      "start_date": "2023-06-30"
    }
  }
}
```

## Statistics Dashboard

The dashboard displays 8 key metrics:

1. **Total Hours** - Total hours worked with percentage of 2,500 hour goal
2. **Days Worked** - Number of days with at least one work session
3. **Average Per Week** - Overall average and last 6 weeks trend
4. **Current Week** - Current week hours plus month and 30-day totals
5. **Est. Completion** - Based on overall average pace
6. **Est. Completion (6-week trend)** - Based on recent pace
7. **Current Streak** - Number of consecutive days worked
8. **Record Streak** - Longest streak with start date

## Color Scale

The heatmap uses a 5-level GitHub-style color intensity:

- **Dark Grey** (#30363d) - 0 hours
- **Dark Green** (#0e4429) - 0.1 to <2 hours
- **Medium Green** (#006d32) - 2 to <4 hours
- **Bright Green** (#26a641) - 4 to <6 hours
- **Brightest Green** (#39d353) - 6+ hours

## Technology Stack

- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** - Vanilla JavaScript, single self-contained file
- **Cal-Heatmap v4** - Calendar heatmap library (via CDN)
- **D3.js v7** - Required dependency for Cal-Heatmap (via CDN)
- **@popperjs/core** - Tooltip positioning (via CDN)
- **No Build Process** - Works immediately when served

## Development

### Install Development Dependencies
